# Part1
-> In this part (Introduction to React) {Ex 1.1|1.2} I've learnt how to create components render ir and use props to assign values<br>
->Part1b Javascript {new language to me} <br><p>
       -->Variables defined through var {not recomended}, let and const for non changing variables<br>
       -->Arrays are objects and if the variable is defined with const it always pints to the obest thus no error is produced when the contents of array is modified</p><br><p>
            --->forEach function with => defining the paramenter iterates through the array<br>
            --->push method is usedto ass new wlwment ot the array<br>
            ---> In React it is adviced to use concat method as it created a new array withoout altering the original array<br>
            --->map method in array creates a new array with mapped corresponding elements and the function paramenter is used to define the elements<br>
            --->Destructing an array can be used to assign variables the values of arrays<br></p><br>
            <p>
       -->Objects
            ---> it can be defied in multiple methods common one is obect literals {}<br>
            --->The values of the properties can be of any type, like integers, strings, arrays, objects...<br>
            --->Object's properties can be refrenced through dot notation and also properties can be added<br>
     <p>-->Functions<br>
            ---> Functions in JavaScript can be defined with => arrow function followed with {} curly braces<br>
            ---> function() expression can also be used define function<br></p>
            <br>
     <h3>Exercises</h3><br><p>
        -> The first exercise 1.3 => we obtain values from obects and use the values to render on react as obejcts are not valid as react child<br>
        -> the exercises in s part defined how to obtain data from object and render the element <br></p>
