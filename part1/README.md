# Part1
-> In this part (Introduction to React) {Ex 1.1|1.2} I've learnt how to create components render ir and use props to assign values
->Part1b Javascript {new language to me} 
       -->Variables defined through var {not recomended}, let and const for non changing variables
       -->Arrays are objects and if the variable is defined with const it always pints to the obest thus no error is produced when the contents of array is modified
            --->forEach function with => defining the paramenter iterates through the array
